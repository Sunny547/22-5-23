Three common things which we do in every programming language are:
1.Storing the data
2.Performing operations on that data
3.Displaying the results

variable:-
        name must start with alphabet
        we cant use special symbols except $_
        after a character you can use a number
        keywords are not allowed 

        data types:-
          number        -6.876.7.12,-7.45
          string        "combination of characters" or ''
          null          not a garbage but something is present
          undefined     like a garbage
          boolean       true or false
          symbol        craetes a unique identity
          BigInt        6755346746876827349876n

    secondary
        object which is a combination of all primary datatypes
        {
            key:value,
            key:value
        }
